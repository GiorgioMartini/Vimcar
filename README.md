# Vimcar Coding Challenge

  - Firs of all thanks for the opportunity, this is my solution to the coding challenge.
  - It's based on create-react-app
  - It uses of course react, Tachyons for Css, and Mobx
  - I had not previous experience with Mobx, but as you use it at Vimcar I though it would be valueble to try and built this with it, it worked fine, but unfortunatelly I had problems Testing it as I've never tested it and I could not get to test it.


To install and run the app please run these commands in the root folder:
  - npm i
  - npm start
  

The app has three buttons which each fetch either Burgers, Pizza or Sushi from the Yelp API, there is also a custom search field so the user can search whatever he feel like. 

The results are cached, so if you press Pizza for the first time, it shows a loading screen, but te next time you try pizza(or a custom search) it loads the results immediatelly as they are cached.

looking forward to your feedback.

Greetings,
Jorge
